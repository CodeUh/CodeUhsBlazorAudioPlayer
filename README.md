# CodeUhsBlazorAudioPlayer
This repository hold the source code for my Blazor WebAssembly Web Client. It includes a custom AudioPlayer component that I can use to quickly add new Tracks and publish them to an Azure storage account which serves the static files of the site to be ran on the users device. I use it to share my music, and test playback on Bluetooth or Airplay enabled devices. Also syncs up nicely to my vehicles audio system.  Here's the link to the site, don't mind it's not secure, I just don't wanna but a cert. I'm not stealing your passwords or anything. https://music.codeuh.com. Here's a some articles I used as reference for using audio in Blazor, and publishing it to an Azure Storage Account.. http://www.appvnext.com/blog/2020/4/20/playing-audio-files-in-a-blazor-application https://anthonychu.ca/post/blazor-azure-storage-static-websites/
